(1)  Define Circles as an empty object if not defined.

(2) Define the Circle function.  The Circle function stores the attributes of a circle:
    center x, center y, radius, color.

(3) Define a randomCircle function.  This function uses the size of the canvas
    to position a circle at random, with the radius defined by our Circle.radius function,
    and colored randomly.

(4) Define a randomColor function.  This function just gives back a random 6 character long
    RGB string in hexidecimal.


(5) Define a radius function.  This function determines the radius of a circle using the size of
    the canvas and the number of circles.

(6) Define a moveRandom method on Circle.  This method generates a small change in x and a small
    change in y and changes the center of the circle accordingly.

(7) define a render method on Circle.  This method take a context (a canvas) (?) and renders
    the circle using beginPath, arc, and fill methods on ctx.
