(1)  Define Circles to be an empty object if it's not yet defined.

(2)  Create a new Game object, also Circles.Game, that takes the dimensions of the canvas.
     The game object will create an array of circles, the number of which is determined by a constant.

(3)  Define a render method on Game.  This method will clear the canvas, then render each circle.

(4)  Define a moveCircles method on Game.  This method goes through the list of circles and
     moves each one, using the move method defined on Circle.

(5)  Define a start method on Game.  This method takes a canvasEl parameter (the canvas).
     This method defines a function called animationCallback that moves the circles,
     renders them, and then requests an animation frame passing itself as the callback function.
     animateCallback is bound to the Game object.  It is then called.

(6*) The game itself is started from the HTML document.  In this doc, the canvas is set up
     using the properties of the window.  A new Circles.Game is created, passing in the
     dimensions of the canvas.  Circles.Game.start is immediately called, passing in the canvas
     element as an argument.
